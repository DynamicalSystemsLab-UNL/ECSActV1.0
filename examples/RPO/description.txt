Here, 'solution_init.h5' contains a known relative periodic orbit, including the period (T), shift (d), and field
data for a single point on the phase space trajectory (grid space representations: QAA, QAB, U, V). The field data is also given in coefficient space, represented
by 2D, complex-valued numpy arrays (QAA_coeff, QAB_coeff, U_coeff, V_coeff)

The activity and channel dimensions are:
	Ra = 2.5
	height = 20.0
	width = 20.0
These and other parameters are contained in the .h5 file.

The script here is the same as '/dedalus/nematics2__RPO.py' except that it increments Ra by 0.01. This is basically
intended to be a nontrivial but (relatively) fast example of the ECS algorithms. 
In realistic computations, the initial guess might not be so good, and convergence will take longer.

Running the script will produce the contents of the 'output' folder.
