Here, 'solution_init.h5' contains a known periodic orbit, including the period (T), shift (d), and field
data for a single point on the phase space trajectory (grid space representations: QAA, QAB, U, V). The field data is also given in coefficient space, represented
by 2D, complex-valued numpy arrays (QAA_coeff, QAB_coeff, U_coeff, V_coeff)

The parameters are contained in the solution_init.h5 file.

The script here is the same as '/dedalus/nematics2__RPO.py' except that it has the PO mode enabled, and increments Ra by 0.005. This is basically intended to be a nontrivial but (relatively) fast example of the ECS algorithms for numerical continuation from a known solution. In realistic computations, the initial guess might not be so good, and convergence will take longer.

Running the script will produce the contents in the 'output' folder.
