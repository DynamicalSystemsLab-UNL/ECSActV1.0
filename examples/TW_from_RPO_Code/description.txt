Here, 'solution_init.h5' contains a known travelling wave, including the period (T), shift (d), and field
data for a single point on the phase space trajectory (grid space representations: QAA, QAB, U, V). The field data is also given in coefficient space, represented
by 2D, complex-valued numpy arrays (QAA_coeff, QAB_coeff, U_coeff, V_coeff)

The parameters are all contained in the same .h5 file.

The script here is the same as '/dedalus/nematics2__RPO.py' except that the TW mode is enabled and it increments Ra by 0.0025. This is basically intended to be a nontrivial but (relatively) fast example of the ECS algorithms for continuation from a known solution.  In realistic computations, the initial guess might not be so good, and convergence will take longer.
