Here, 'solution_init.h5' contains a known equilibrium point, including the period (T), shift (d), and field
data (grid space representations: QAA, QAB, U, V). The field data is also given in coefficient space, represented
by 2D, complex-valued numpy arrays (QAA_coeff, QAB_coeff, U_coeff, V_coeff)

The parameters are also contained in the same .h5 file.

The script here is the same as '/dedalus/nematics2__RPO.py' except that it has the EQ mode enabled and increments Ra by 0.005. This is basically intended to be a nontrivial but (relatively) fast example of the ECS algorithms showing the numerical continuation from know EQ. 
In realistic computations, the initial guess might not be so good, and convergence will take longer.

Running the script will produce the contents of the 'output' folder.
