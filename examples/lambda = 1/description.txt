Run the script nematics2_td.py to compute time-dependent forward simulation. 

Here, 'initial_data.h5' contains an initial condition corresponding to a single point on the phase space trajectory (grid space representations: QAA, QAB, U, V). The field data is also given in coefficient space, represented
by 2D, complex-valued numpy arrays (QAA_coeff, QAB_coeff, U_coeff, V_coeff)

The parameters are also contained in the solution_init.h5 file.
